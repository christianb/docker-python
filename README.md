# docker-python
This is a docker container for [Python](https://www.python.org/) development.

Why do I need a docker container for Python? Well, first of all I wanna have a simple reproducible way of installing Python without the need to look into the documentation and select all dependencies I need. Second, I do not wanna pollute my OS with all the required dependencies.

Execute `run.sh` to build and start the container.
